"""
Examples module for OpenAI Agents Python SDK.

This directory contains example implementations showcasing various features and use cases
of the OpenAI Agents Python SDK.

# Make the examples directory into a package to avoid top-level module name collisions.
# This is needed so that mypy treats files like examples/customer_service/main.py and
# examples/researcher_app/main.py as distinct modules rather than both named "main".
